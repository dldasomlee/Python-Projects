#Low-Wage Job Rates
I am trying to figure out the percentage of recent graduates who took on a low wage job after finishing college using pandas and compare the data sets.ss

##Data
Grabbed data from [this](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors) repo originally.</p>
I will be using,
- all-ages.csv: Employment data by major for all ages
- recent-grads.csv: Employment data by major for recent college graduates only

The American Community Survey is a U.S. Census Bureau survey that collects data on everything from housing affordability to industry employment rates. For this challenge, you'll be using the data that the team at FiveThirtyEight derived from the 2010-2012 American Community Surveys. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the data set and made it available in a Github repository.
