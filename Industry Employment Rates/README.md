#Low-Wage Job Rates
I am trying to figure out the percentage of recent graduates who took on a low wage job after finishing colleges using pandas and compare the data sets.

##Data
Grabbed data from [this](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors) repo originally.
I will be using,
- all-ages.csv: Employment data by major for all ages
- recent-grads.csv: Employment data by major for recent college graduates only

The U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, collected data and amongst the number of data sets, [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight) cleaned the 2010-2012 American Community Surveys and made it available in a Github repository.
