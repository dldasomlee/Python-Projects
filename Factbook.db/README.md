# SQLite practices
In this **project/practice**, I am trying to create and use indexes for better performance. 

## Data set
I am grabbing the world factbook posted by [Gerald Bauer](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql), and this is originally published by the CIA. Factbook.db is offering free country profiles in the public domain. 
- factbook.db

In above page, he also includes,
- Database Schema / Tables / Columns
- Usage
- Command line tool and scripts for building your own up-to-date copy
