#Visualize Gender Gap in STEM Fields
I am trying to figure out in which STEM major, which gender dominates or have balanced categories.

##Data
Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data containing the percentage of women's bachelor's degrees 
from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees. It is origianlly from [the Department of Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp). 
I will be using,
