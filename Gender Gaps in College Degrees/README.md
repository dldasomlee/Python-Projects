#Visualization of Gender Gaps in STEM, Liberal Arts, and other degrees
First, I am trying to figure out in which STEM major, which gender dominates or have balanced categories.
Then, I am going to include all degrees to compare whole degrees.

##Data
Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data containing the percentage of women's bachelor's degrees 
from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees. It is origianlly from [the Department of Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp).

I will be using,
- percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv

##Findings
- Comparison on STEMs
  - Gender gaps in CS and Engineering are bigger and dominated more by men 
  - Gender gaps in Biology and Math and Statistics are smaller and balanced
  
- Comparison on 6 degrees, Engineering, Computer Science, Psychology, Biology, Physical Sciences, and Math and Statistics
  - Degrees where women dominate are psychology 
  - Degrees where men dominate are Engineering, CS, Physical Sciences, Math and Statistics
  - Big gaps in gender are Engineering, CS, Psychology
  - Gender gaps are decreasing are Biology and Physial Sciences 
  - Math and Statistics are balanced
